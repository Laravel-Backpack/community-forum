# Backpack for Laravel Ideas

This repo only exists so that we can talk about improvement ideas, feature requests, etc without bloating up the Issues section of [laravel-backpack/crud](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/crud). We'll be moving issues here to talk more about them before they're actionable. When we have a clear plan to do them we can move them back to the appropriate repo.

This is basically an alternative to the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/CRUD/discussions) board, which is in beta, and still doesn't have a few sensible features (can't have tags, can't be included in projects, can't assign people, can't convert an issue to a discussion then back to an issue).
