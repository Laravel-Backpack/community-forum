# Backpack for Laravel - Community Forum

If you have an idea or question and don't know where to post is, this is the place. This is where we recommend you:
- üí° [post an improvement idea, feature request](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/ideas/issues/new) etc.
- ü¶ü [report a bug](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/ideas/issues/new) (we'll move it to the right repo);
- ‚ùì [ask for help](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/ideas/discussions/new?category=general) (keep it reasonable though);

All other Backpack repos are used for task management - our goal is to get them to zero issues, zero PRs. 
This repo is different. In this repo... anything goes. This community forum will completely replace our Gitter chatroom, which was a mess. In here:
- we can keep _support questions_ ([Discussions](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/ideas/discussions)) separate from _feature requests and bugs_ ([Issues](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/ideas/issues));
- we can keep an open, searchable record of conversations; one answer today might help someone in the future too;
- we can turn feedback, insight and ideas into actionable items, because the conversation can include more people (threads ftw);

Help us make this forum a better place. Interact with us and other developers. Give your 2 cents. Report what you find. Teach others what you learn. Show others what you build. We want to learn from each other and collaborate, to make all our lives better. **The only rule we have is... be kind.**

Let's have fun and build cool shit. See you in the comments.
